## About

This site aims to serve as a hub for the scholarly and academic study of anarchism in Ukraine, highlighting the history of the movement from its origins in the 19th-century through its expression in the Makhnovist movement of the early 20th-century. Resources curated here were selected for their scholarly value and contributions to the understanding of this history. The materials highlighted from the [UT Austin Libraries’](https://www.lib.utexas.edu/) distinctive collections were also selected due to their being rare or unique to North American libraries’ holdings, making them of potential interest to researchers interested in examining hard-to-find-materials.
